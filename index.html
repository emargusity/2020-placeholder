<!-- *********

Hey you!
Thanks for peeking my code! I hope you find it to be mostly neat and sensible.

I spent the better part of 7 months coding this myself. The reason it took so long is that I chose to rewrite it three times after deciding this would be a great opportunity to learn SCSS and SASS. And OH MAN SCSS IS THE BEST.

Because of my commitment to understanding code (key word: understanding), I have the trust of the developers I work with and will frequently request GIT access to make those obnoxious designer tweaks.

Feel free to isolate my branch from the dev branch. I recognize and respect the beautiful tapestry that is a production website.

Anyway. Have a nice day!
Eric Margusity
